<h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
<p>Chemistry is the branch of scoence that deals with the properties, composition, and behaviour of matter. It is a fascinationg field that explores the building blocks of the universe.</p>

<h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
<p> The periodic table is a tabular assrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for iron, H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen, Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their properties.</p>

<h3>Chemical Equations</h3>
<p>Chemical reactions are represented using <i>chemical equations.</i> <b>Here</b>'s an example of a chemical reaction:</p>
<p>2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> <var> â†’ </var> 2H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
<p>This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>) and oxygen gas (O<sub>2</sub>) to form water (H<sub>2</sub>O).</p>

<h4>Important Concepts</h4>
<p>Stochiometry is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. it involves balacing chemical equation to ensure mass and charge are conserved.</p>
<p><sub>Subscipts</sub> indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule,while <sup>superscripts</sup> represent charges or the number of atoms in an ion.</p>


<h5>Conclusion</h5>
<p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we breathe to that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.</p>
